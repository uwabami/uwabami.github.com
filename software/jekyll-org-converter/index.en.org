  Add [[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] support into Jekyll,
  with Org-mode options as YAML Front Matter.

  This library parse your org-mode file's =+OPTIONS=, and use as Jekyll YAML Front Matter.
  Thus you don't need YAML Front Matter when you write articles/posts as Org file.
* Depends
  - jekyll
  - org-ruby
* Usage
  - Download this files into your plugin directory ( normally, =_plugins= ).
  - (optional) Create =_html_tags.yml= into your top directory, if you want to custom tags.
* limitation
  If you want to upload GitHub pages, you can't use any plugins.
  Thus please consider other methods, simply export org file as html, and use jekyll as normal way.
